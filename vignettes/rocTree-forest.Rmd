In this vignette, we demonstrate how to use the `rocForest` function in __`rocTree`__ package
to fit the proposed Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) guided survival tree.

## Simulated data

We will demonstrate the usage of `rocForest` function with a simulated data prepared by the [`simu`](https://www.sychiou.com/rocTree/articles/rocTree-sim.html) function.
```{R load}
library(rocTree)
set.seed(2019)
dat <- simu(n = 100, cen = 0.25, sce = 2.1, summary = TRUE)
```

## The `rocForest` function


The complete list of arguments in `rocForest` are as follow:
```{R rocForest-arg}
args(rocForest)
```

The arguments are as follows
