In this vignette, we demonstrate how to use the `rocTree()` function in __`rocTree`__ package
to fit the emsemble method.

## Simulated data

We will demonstrate the usage of `rocForest` function with a simulated data prepared by the [`simu`](https://www.sychiou.com/rocTree/articles/rocTree-sim.html) function.
```{R load}
library(rocTree)
set.seed(2019)
dat <- simu(n = 100, cen = 0.25, sce = 2.1, summary = TRUE)
```

## The ensembles

The ensemble method can be easily called by setting `ensemble = TRUE` (default) when fitting a `rocTree()`.
Ensemble method improve the variance reduction of bagging
by reducing the correlation between the trees via random selection of predictors in the tree-
growing process.
In the following, we apply the ensemble method with fully grown trees with small terminal nodes and without pruning.
We first load the `survival` package to enable `Surv`.
A random forest with 500 survival trees can be grown as follow:
```{R tree, tidy = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
library(survival)
system.time(fit <- rocTree(Surv(Time, death) ~ z1 + z2, id = id, data = dat, ensemble = TRUE))
```
Some of the important parameters can be printed directly.
```{R print, tidy = TRUE}
fit
```

The function `rocTree` returns an object of S3 class.
The 500 survival trees are stored in `fit$trees`.
These survival trees can be printed and plotted with the generic function `print` and `plot`, respectively.
For example, the first of the 500 survival trees can be printed/plotted as below.
```{R tree1}
print(fit, tree = 1)
plot(fit, tree = 1)
```
The other trees can be printed/plotted similarly by specifying the `tree` argument.
Users are referred to the [Package vignette on fitting time-invariant survival tree](https://www.sychiou.com/rocTree/articles/rocTree-tree.html) 
for different printing/plotting options. 


## Prediction

Suppose we have a new data that is generated as below:
```{R newDat}
newdat <- dplyr::tibble(Time = sort(unique(dat$Time)), 
                        z1 = 1 * (Time < median(Time)), 
                        z2 = runif(1))
newdat
```
The predicted survival curve can be plotted with the following codes.
```{R pred}
pred <- predict(fit, newdat)
pred
plot(pred)
```
