### ROC-guided survival trees and ensembles
***

### Development

The package is under active development.

### Installation

You can install `rocTree` from **GitHub** with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
## install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stc04003/rocTree")
```

### Description
The `rocTree` provides implementations to a unified framework for tree-structured analysis with censored survival outcomes.
Different from many existing tree building algorithms, the `rocTree` package incorporate time-dependent covariates by constructing 
a time-invariant partition scheme on the survivor population. The partition-based risk prediction function is constructed 
using an algorithm guided by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. 
Specifically, the generalized time-dependent ROC curves for survival trees show that the target hazard function yields the highest ROC curve. 
The optimality of the target hazard function motivates us to use a weighted
average of the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) on a set of time points to
evaluate the prediction performance of survival trees and to guide splitting and pruning.
Moreover, the `rocTree` package also offers a novel ensemble algorithm, where the ensemble is on unbiased
martingale estimating equations.
