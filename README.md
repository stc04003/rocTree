### ROC-guided survival trees and forests

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Development

The package is under active development.

### Installation

You can install `rocTree` from **GitHub** with:

``` r
## install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stc04003/rocTree")
```

### Description

The `rocTree` provides implementations to a unified framework for tree-structured analysis with censored survival outcomes. Different from many existing tree building algorithms, the `rocTree` incorporate time-dependent covariates by constructing a time-invariant partition scheme on the survivor population. The partition-based risk prediction function is constructed using an algorithm guided by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Specifically, the generalized time-dependent ROC curves for survival trees show that the target hazard function yields the highest ROC curve. The optimality of the target hazard function motivates us to use a weighted average of the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) on a set of time points to evaluate the prediction performance of survival trees and to guide splitting and pruning. Moreover, the `rocTree` package also offers a novel risk prediction forest algorithm, where the ensemble is on unbiased martingale estimating equations.
