\title{rocTree:Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)-Guided Classification and Survival Tree}
\description{
\code{rocTree} uses a ROC-guided classification algorithm to grow and prune survival trees.
Hazards at terminal notes are also computed.
}
\section{Introduction}{

Existing classification, regression, and survival trees are typically implemented via a
greedy algorithm that maximizes the within node homogeneity or between node heterogeneity.
Sun and Wang (2018+) re-define the ROC curves for tree classifiers using the idea of
randomized test and show that the target function yields the highest ROC curve.
Then a criterion based on ROC is used in the tree-building algorithm.
}

\section{Methods}{

The package contains functions to construct ROC-guided survival trees (\code{\link{rocTree}}).

set.seed(1)
dat <- simu(100, 0, 1.3)
library(survival)
data(simudat)
system.time(fit <- rocTree(Surv(Time, death) ~ z1 + z2, id = id, data = dat,
control = list(CV = TRUE, nflds = 10)))
fit
